\title{Visualizes a measure for well calibration on the RBP curve.}
\usage{
addWellCalib(obj, plot.values = TRUE, col = greycol(10), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{[\code{\link{RBPObj}}]\cr
Data container for RBP curve.}

\item{plot.values}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Whether the values of the corresponding measure should be added to the plot?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{col}{[\code{character}(10) | \code{numeric}(10) ]\cr
A specification for the the plotting color for the areas.}

\item{...}{currently not used}
}
\value{
A matrix that contains the average of the "probabilities within deciles" conditional on Y.
}
\description{
A measure for a well calibrated model can be obtained by grouping the predicted
probabilities via deciles and comparing the mean of the predicted probabilities within each
decile in the two groups that are determined by the target variable.
